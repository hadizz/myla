# Task:

we aim to build an bot in slack that iss going to ask calrification questuion to understand the istuation, it will ask questions of the members chatting in threads in the slack. issue is we have alot of threads and messages debating a problem or seeking for naswers. and employees forget them because they are long and frustrating. so the agent is going to act as a facilitator. gather information about the relevent topic. and just give facts not deicision about the situtation. it might ask sepearete questions from the users that are in the chat.
example: 2 employees are debating to add new state management library in frontned. they have different opinions. its a long thread. so here the facilator tries to make the conversation goes faster. also if a new joiner is in the team or other team members that waste time will just get updated about the debate and can give their opinion to the bot or the chat. the agent will create doc in notion for example and tommorow the teammates will talk about it in the meeting. also agent is connected to the chat history of slack, google docs, confluenece, jira borad, other data sources. people will trigger bot in the slack with mention to ask them to please facilate here. so we will reduce the unnecesary notifications, summaries the debates in a clean doc. faliator agent is just facilating. so if it needs more skilled thing it will call other agents that are basically slaces to it. faciliator is master and other are slaves. like tech agent, marketing agent, financial... master will call them for getting more info and knoweledeg and it will return them with knoweledge and facilator can send reports and thoughts back to the thread or docs.
