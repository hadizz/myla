# HR Holiday Plans (Upcoming Month)

Internal note from HR to track out-of-office plans for engineering. Dates assume the upcoming calendar month; adjust if project timelines shift.

## Summary Table

| Developer | Holiday |
|-----------|---------|
| Hadi | 3–7 |
| Alireza | 14–18  |
| Jake | 24–28 |

## New Team Member

Iselda joins the team on the 10th as a frontend-focused developer. She previously led interface modernization at a SaaS company, building stateful dashboards with React, Zustand, and Typescript, and mentoring junior engineers on component architecture. Expect a two-week onboarding sprint paired with Alireza once he returns.

## Action Items
- HR to confirm PTO entries are approved in the HRIS by Friday EOD.
- Engineering manager to verify sprint commitments reflect reduced capacity (roughly 40% down week of 24th).
- Remind team to update shared calendar invites for any cross-team ceremonies they skip.
